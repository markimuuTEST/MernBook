To run the Mern application in localhost/development mode do this:

`cd client`
`npm run start`

Both client and server should start. If client is up before server, just refresh page.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
